       "'The theme establishes a structure for spatial referencing of features by coordinates. This topic shall link to appropriate standards for information technology and data where possible, and provide a framework for the development of sector-specific applications using geographic data.\\\\n\\\\n ISO 19111 describes the conceptual schema and defines the description for a minimum data to two cases for which 1-, 2- and 3- dimensional coordinates reference system information shall be given. The first case is given by a coordinate reference system to which a set of coordinates is related. The second case consists of a coordinate operation (coordinate transformation, coordinate conversion, concatenated coordinate operation) to change coordinate values from one coordinate reference system to another. \\\\n\\\\nThere are no explicit accuracy numbers given in ISO 19111. We must consider that it has been developed for geographic information in general, but not for precise positioning. Spatial information may be referenced to the earth surface with an improving accuracy on the global scale for the future. Such high accuracy level may be required for some themes of the Directive, e.g., the trans-European railway transport network. Spatial referencing could no longer be considered as constant in time, if we reach the sub-centimetre level. We need additional parameters compared to ISO 19111 in that case, because that document considers changes in time of the coordinate reference only system through the \"date of realisation\". This model is not suitable to describe continuous movements of the spatial reference. Kinematic models or so-called \"loading models\" are examples to incorporate such dynamics. A re-iteration of accuracy aspects may be needed, if specifications for Annex I and II are ready.\\\\n\\\\n The spatial referencing is usually referred to selected points of the earth surface. Such point are, e.g., given by geodetic markers, stations performing permanent satellite observations, levelling benchmarks, or tide gauges. As soon as the marker coordinates are given, they provide a direct access to the realisation of the coordinate reference system.'"

      "Geodaten des Bundesamtes für Energie, als WMS der swisstopo bezogen. Der Windatlas Schweiz beschreibt die Windverhältnisse auf fünf Höhen über Grund: 50, 75, 100, 125 und 150 m. Die Daten basieren auf einer schweizweiten Modellierung mit einer horizontalen Gitterweite von 100 m. In der Karte ist für jeden Gitterpunkt der modellierte Jahresmittelwert der Windgeschwindigkeit dargestellt. Die Verteilung der Windgeschwindigkeiten in Windgeschwindigkeitsklassen kann mit den Weibullparametern A (Skalenparameter) und k (Formparameter) angenähert werden. Aus den Weibullparametern kann nicht direkt auf den Mittelwert der Windgeschwindigkeit geschlossen werden, da es sich um eine Annäherung an eine Windverteilung handelt und diese nicht für jeden Standort ausreichend wiedergegeben werden kann. Die Windrose zeigt die relative Häufigkeit der modellierten Windrichtungen. Pro Sektor sind die gemittelten Windgeschwindigkeiten und zugehörigen Weibullparameter ersichtlich. Für die Berechnung der Windgeschwindigkeiten und Windrichtungen sind langjährige Messungen in die Modellierung eingeflossen. Da die Messpunkte schweizweit nicht überall in einer angemessenen Dichte vorhanden sind und Ungenauigkeiten bei der Modellierung von Windströmungen im komplexen Gelände auftreten, sind die Resultate mit Unsicherheiten behaftet. Die Grössenordnung der Unsicherheiten liegen im Jurabogen bei bis zu +/- 0.5m/s, im Mittelland bei bis zu +/- 0.7m/s, in den Voralpen bei bis zu +/- 0.5m/s und in den Alpen bei bis zu +/- 1.3m/s. Für die Karten ab 100m Höhe über Grund stehen markant weniger Messungen für die Modellierung zu Verfügung. Dies resultiert in einer höheren Unsicherheit der Ergebnisse. Die Angaben sind als grobe Einschätzung der Windverhältnisse zu verstehen. Bei Interesse an einer Standortentwicklung ist eine Messung vor Ort unumgänglich.\n",

Sie fallen durchs Gitter in die unterliegende Rinne und folgen von dort dem Leitsystem zum nächsten Eimer oder Durchlass. Die Lage der Stopprinnen wurde im Feld durch die Aufnahme ihres Anfangs- und Endpunktes ermittelt (Aufnahmegerät: GPS von der Firma Leica, System 1200, Genauigkeit im Wald: 1m).

Sie enthalten Leit- und Vernetzungsstrukturen und bieten ein ausreichendes Angebot an Deckung. Intakte Korridore sollen erhalten werden.
